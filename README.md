### Getting started
This project is developed using `npm 18.15.0`

Open a terminal and run `npm install`

And then `npm run start`

This project expects that the `api` is running on `localhost:8000` so if for some reason you are running the `api` on another port / domain you will have to change the value of the const `API_BASE_URL` stored on the App.js file.
